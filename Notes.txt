Sunday 8/22
Decided to add a database layer.
SQLite took a little longer to set up the way I originally went around doing it.
Got SQLite to run in the Project package so DB can be spun up on initial start up with Main arguments.
Transitioned Persistence layer to DB rather than text file. 
Kept the Text file load functionality.
Finished Testing layer to trouble shoot SQL issues and check some input security.


*this version of SQLite did not support foreign keys which is unfortunate.

Future State
Would like to have time for a UI layer but SQL took a bit longer than i had hoped.
Query reasons by user would be nice.
Sustained User log in to remove User checks.
Bulk adding of reasons from different users.
Entity framework input to DB.

Need to move the SQLDatabase info to config.
Need to set up test files to be useful outside of development setting.

Missing controls for missing files and other issues with file typing of input files.
